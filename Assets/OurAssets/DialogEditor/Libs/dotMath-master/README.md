dotMath 
==================================================

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/dotMath.svg?maxAge=2592000)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotMath/)

This is a fork of the [dotMath](http://dotmath.codeplex.com/) library by Stephen Hebert, currently hosted on CodePlex, which hasn't been updated since 2004. The documentation found here and on the wiki is mostly pulled from the CodePlex site.

dotMath is also now available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/dotMath/).

Overview
--------------------------------------------------

Welcome to dotMath, an extensible mathematical expression compiler for .NET. The library allows for variable handling, an entire function library and the ability to add your own functions.

If you need to evaluate fixed or variable expressions, dotMath is your solution:

**Fixed expression example:**

    (sin(5)* cos(4/5)) / 3

**Variable expression example:**

    (sin(a)* cos(b/a)) / c

_The original binary from the project's 1.0 release can be found on [CodePlex](http://dotmath.codeplex.com/releases/view/875)._
