
Add on v1.1a HOTFIX

- Our ThirdPersonController Template use the CrossPlatformInput Scripts from the StandardAssets
along with our InvectorJoystick.cs that only modified the Original Joystick script to a circular movement 
instead of a Square shape.

- Do not delete the Standard Assets folder, otherwise our scripts will not work correctly for Mobile builds.
- If you delete, you can import the package again and select only the missing CrossPlatform files.
